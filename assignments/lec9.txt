If the manager does not wait for confirmations, the protocol could fail if a server that is not the owner or manager of the table, wants to read a page. In this case, the reader will ask for permission to read, and lock its own threads. If, before reading, the manager of the table decides to write, it sends out its invalidate messages, locks the table, and writes the table. The reader will then read the value -- which could now possibly be in inconsistant state during the write -- even though the read request was made previously.
