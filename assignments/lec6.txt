Suppose we have the scenario shown in the Raft paper's Figure 7: a cluster of seven servers, with the log contents shown. The first server crashes (the one at the top of the figure), and cannot be contacted. A leader election ensues. For each of the servers marked (a), (d), and (f), could that server be elected? If yes, which servers would vote for it? If no, what specific Raft mechanism(s) would prevent it from being elected?

The end of section 5.4.1 of the Raft paper explains the "at least as up to date" rule. Followers will only vote for a candidate if the candidate has a higher last term than the voter. In the event of equal last terms, the candidate must have a longer log.

By this rule:

Server A:
- A would vote for itself
- B would vote for A
- C would not vote for A because it has a longer log than it
- D would not vote for A because D has a higher last entry than A
- E would vote for A
- F would vote for A because A has a higher last entry than F

A can get a total of 4/6 votes, and thus could be elected leader.


Server D:
Because D has the highest last entry and longest log, every other follower would vote for it, and thus it could be elected leader.


Server F:
Because Server F's last entry is lower than the last entry of every other follower, nobody would vote for it (except itself) and thus it would not get the majority and can not be elected leader.
