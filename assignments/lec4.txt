It depends. The metadata server only gives the new TLT to clients once all of the new tractservers have acked that they are now handling T1's tracts. If T1 recovers before all tractservers ack, it could still handle reads from clients with the old (pre-failure) TLT cached. Writes would be sent out to all tractservers in the client's TLT, but if any of the tractservers other than T1 had received the new TLT, they would reject the request and tell the client to update its table.
