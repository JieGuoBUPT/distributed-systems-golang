Given that Spanner makes heavy use of hardware-assisted time synchronization using GPS and atomic clocks, has some cost-benefit analysis been performed to determine when Spanner is appropriate? Is it relatively out of the reach of smaller-scale projects? 

I'm a little confused about how open-source projects like CockroachDB and TreodeDB can be implementing Spanner without access to special hardware...
