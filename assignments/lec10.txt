Treadmarks sends write notice messages in the intervals, which contain information aobut which pages have been invalidated. They don't include the actual modifications, but instead allow the processor to request them. If variables span multiple memory pages, Treadmarks's interval messages optimizes which pages were invalidated and should be sent. In Dreadmarks however, we need to send the entire chunk of memory space for both pages whenever a new processor wants to acquire a lock on that variable.
