In section 2.5, the paper says that the updates are stored in an in-memory buffer until the checkpoint has been received. By increasing the checkpointing interval, we have to also have to allocate more memory to store this information. Additionally, the pipelining of the checkpoints is handled by an epoch-based system that briefly pausing the system during the snapshot to maintain atomicity. The longer the intervals between snapshots, the more annoying the pause would be.
