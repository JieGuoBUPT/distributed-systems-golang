As the scenario illustrated in example 1 shows, it can definitely be problematic to use relaxed conssitency for social applications when users have an expectation that their actions are processed in order, especialy for privacy concerns. Section 4 says that because "the dissemination of these updates ... does not have to be real time", PNUT's relaxed consistency model works well for social media applications. 

Though it could be hazardous if ALL reads were of the most relaxed consistency degree, the benefit of PNUTS's approach is that it (1) is per-record timeline consistent, and (2) allows applications to specify the degree of read consistency. This means that developers of social media apps can carefully reason about the degree of consistency needed for each operation in order to provide a safe and reliable experience for their users.
